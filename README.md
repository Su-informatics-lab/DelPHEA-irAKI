# DelPHEA-irAKI

**Del**phi **P**ersonalized **H**ealth **E**xplainable **A**gents for **i**mmune-**r**elated **AKI** Classification: 
A agent-simulated Delphi clinical decision support system for distinguishing immune-related AKI from other AKI etiologies 
using clinical notes and structured data.

## Overview

DelPHEA-irAKI implements a novel approach to immune-related AKI classification by simulating a virtual panel of medical 
experts conducting a modified Delphi consensus process. The system combines multiple LLM agents, each representing 
different medical specialties relevant to immune-mediated kidney injury, to collaboratively assess whether AKI cases 
are immune-related through iterative discussion and evidence-based reasoning.

### Expert Panel Configuration

The system uses JSON configuration files to define expert panels:

```json
{
  "expert_panel": {
    "experts": [
      {
        "id": "oncologist_001",
        "specialty": "medical_oncology",
        "name": "Dr. Sarah Chen",
        "experience_years": 15,
        "expertise": ["immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicities", "irAEs"],
        "focus_areas": ["temporal relationship analysis", "irAE correlation"],
        "reasoning_style": "evidence-based, protocol-driven"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Clinical Questionnaire

The assessment questions are also configurable via JSON:

```json
{
  "questionnaire": {
    "questions": [
      {
        "id": "Q1", 
        "category": "temporal_relationship",
        "question": "The temporal relationship between ICI exposure and AKI onset strongly supports irAKI diagnosis",
        "clinical_context": {
          "supportive_evidence": ["AKI onset 2-5 months after ICI initiation"],
          "contradictory_evidence": ["AKI onset before ICI therapy"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

3. **Postrenal Exclusion**: Obstruction, structural abnormalities
4. **Other Intrinsic Exclusion**: ATN, contrast nephropathy, other drugs
5. **Urinalysis Pattern**: Proteinuria, hematuria, cellular casts
6. **Immune Activation**: Systemic inflammatory markers
7. **Concomitant Medications**: PPI, NSAID, antibiotic assessment
8. **Other irAE Correlation**: Multi-organ immune manifestations
9. **Biopsy Indication**: Expected immune-mediated pathology
10. **Treatment Response**: Clinical course and steroid response
11. **Alternative Diagnosis Exclusion**: Systematic differential assessment  
12. **Clinical Gestalt**: Overall irAKI likelihood
